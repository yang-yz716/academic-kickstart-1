The algorithm is based on the Kunpeng 920 acceleration, the test transfer amount is a 32-bit positive integer, the transfer record is 2 million, it takes 2.74 seconds, and the accuracy rate is 100%.

The algorithm test result won the top 64 in the Jiangshan Division and was promoted to the semi-finals. Unfortunately, due to the acceptance of the project group project, I did not continue to participate in the follow-up competition.
