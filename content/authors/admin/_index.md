When I stood on the field of ROBOCON competition in 2017's, behind was the encouragement of teammates and in front of was the hope of victory. At that moment I fell in love with Robotics. As the major of automation student, I feel honor when I processed the part of robot, welded circuit board and debug the program. Every coherent action of the robot is the most beautiful art in my eyes. And when I was familiar with the bottom knowledge of robotics, the top task of robot in perception and planning was my goal.

The movies “Edge of Tomorrow” and “Next” inspire me with the method of learning for the automatic robot. In my opinion, the deep reinforcement learning can help robots achieve the same performance as movies by designing reasonable strategy of learning. Parsing and utilizing effective environment information of the 3D scene is not trivial due to
the complexity of the 3D environment and the limited ability for reasoning about our visual world. Of course, the day has not yet come, and seems to be difficult, but it is because of its uncertainty that it's worth studying.
